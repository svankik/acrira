This plugin implements the [Chosen jQuery Plugin](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) for WordPress.

[Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly. 

This plugin applies Chosen to any select box in your post and page content. It only loads the Javascript if a post in question includes a select box or the `[contact-form]` shortcode of a supported plugin.

The [Grunion Contact Form](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/) & [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/) plugins are both supported. 

If you want need to force the Chosen script & styles to load on a page, simply include `[chosen]` within the page. 

### Installation 

1. Unzip and upload `/chosen/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Chosen will apply to all select boxes automatically
